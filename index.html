        <h2>Welcome to Our Campaign</h2>
        <p>We aim to raise awareness about discrimination against journalists and human rights defenders. Freedom of speech is a fundamental right that must be protected.</p>
        <p>Every day, journalists face threats, censorship, and violence simply for reporting the truth. Governments, corporations, and extremist groups often attempt to silence those who challenge their actions. We must unite to defend press freedom and human rights.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="left1">
        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>Journalists and human rights defenders are often targeted for exposing corruption and injustice. Without their work, many critical issues would remain hidden from the public.</p>
        <p>We must take action to ensure their safety and uphold press freedom.</p>
        <p>Discrimination against journalists takes many forms, including wrongful imprisonment, harassment, digital surveillance, and even murder. In many countries, perpetrators go unpunished, which perpetuates a cycle of fear and self-censorship.</p>
        <p>Without a free press, democracy suffers, misinformation spreads, and societies become vulnerable to authoritarian control. This is why protecting journalists is not just about their safety—it’s about preserving truth and justice for all.</p>

        <h2>About SDG 16.10</h2>
        <p>SDG 16.10 focuses on ensuring public access to information and protecting fundamental freedoms. It is a crucial part of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p>
        <p>However, achieving this goal is difficult due to threats against journalists and activists. Many face violence, imprisonment, or even death for speaking out.</p>
        <p>To combat this, we must advocate for stronger legal protections, hold perpetrators accountable, and support independent media organizations.</p>
        <p>International organizations such as Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists work tirelessly to document abuses and push for global policies that safeguard press freedom. Governments must also step up by enforcing laws that protect journalists and punishing those responsible for crimes against them.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, digital platforms play a significant role in modern journalism. While they offer opportunities for information sharing, they also pose new challenges, such as cyber harassment and government surveillance. Striking a balance between security and free speech is essential.</p>
        <p>One of the key ways to support SDG 16.10 is by promoting media literacy and ensuring that the public understands the importance of independent journalism. When societies value and protect journalists, they help create an informed, engaged, and empowered population that can hold governments accountable.</p>
        <p>Additionally, civil society organizations, legal institutions, and the international community must collaborate to pressure oppressive regimes and fight against censorship. Supporting journalists through emergency funds, safe reporting channels, and legal aid is crucial in ensuring they can continue their work without fear.</p>
        <p>Every individual has a role to play. Whether it’s supporting ethical journalism, speaking out against misinformation, or advocating for policy changes, everyone can contribute to the protection of fundamental freedoms and the right to information.</p>

    <p>Human rights violations-especially human trafficking and forced labor-are rampant in conflict-affected states. International laws designed to protect people have been ignored, thus jeopardizing global standard human rights.</p>
    
    
    
    
        <p>Despite these limited impacts, war also has long-term effects. It is affecting prices for food, fuel, and fertilizers, disrupting global trade, and impacting financial markets, which could lead to a global food crisis, to name one consequence of the war. Along with crisis in Ukraine, a lot of other conquests also need attention and assistance. In the past 10 years, $349 billion has gone to peacekeeping, humanitarian aid, and refugee support.</p>
        
        
        
        
    <p> As conflict continues to act as an enormous public health risk, those who are on the edge-the poor, the old, and the not-so-vibrant-population-will obviously face the huge impact. The Secretary-General has urged all violence parties in conflicts to negotiate in order to stop further threats to global security. </p>

    <div class="main" >
        <h1>What is UN SDG 16.10 and what it entails.</h1>
        <p> UN SDG 16.10 calls out the horrors and evils that are persisting in conflict zones and certain countries that regard the lives and rights of journalists, human right activists, etc in those countries.
            In other words, it talks about how people are being discriminated against and harmed in places around the world for simply trying to bring awareness or talk about a topic. 
            We believe that this is toxic and dehumanizing. People should not have their life taken from them for simply speaking their minds and gathering information. This is wrong and is not something that any human being should have to go through.
        </p>
    
        <p>The role played by the media during conflict goes beyond being mere information-reporting and accountability mechanisms. Media coverage plays its part in documenting violations and, when possible, investigations and, ideally, accountability. However, this crucial role is besmirched by an increasing hazard in which journalists must tread. 320 human rights defenders, journalists, and trade unionists were killed in 2023 worldwide, while conflict zones have witnessed a disturbing rise in the killing of journalists, reversing an optimistic trend before. In Gaza and beyond, the media has come under attack physically as well as through the political rhetoric that has been unleashed, entrenching a poisonous environment of suspicion that undermines journalism's role within any democracy.</p>
    
        <p>None of the conflicts, however, were confined only to journalists. Civilians in conflict zones, especially children, are suffering great hardships. Over 100 million people have been forcibly displaced from their homes due to armed conflict, violence, and human rights violations, according to the UN. Nearly 41% of those displaced are children, truck-loads of suffering. Physical and sexual violence, limited access to education, and infection with long-term trauma. Besides, in Ukraine, the war has thrown an economic crisis into the throes, lifting the prices of food, fuel, and fertilizer higher than they have ever been and swinging global trade into the horns of a global food supply crisis.</p>
    
        <img src="sdgstop.jpg" width="600px" height="375px" style="border-radius: 5px; margin-left: 5px; display: flex;" class="wrap-image"> 
    
        <p style="margin-left: 625px; margin-bottom: 800px;">Human trafficking, forced labor, and other forms of exploitation run unchecked in the context of these conflict-stricken areas, thereby underscoring the increasing insensitivity to international humanitarian law. Such circumstances undermine the global compact for human rights, which is meant to ensure the continued protection of basic rights even during wartime. In spite of the huge financial outlays by the international community for peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, and refugee assistance, these violations spiral out of control.</p>

    <div class="Dis"><div class="defender"><img src="defender.jpg"><p>The Human Rights Defenders Summit 1998 put the issue of the safety and protection of HRDs on the map for governments, donor agencies, international NGOs and regional mechanisms. Since 1998, the world of support for HRDs has expanded profoundly and institutional space has been created to address HRD issues, including the establishment of the mandate for the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and similar regional mechanisms, within national governments and institutions, and among the international human rights movement.

        The 1998 Summit helped create the world in which both HRDs work and in which an array of institutions, foundations, and organizations engage with HRDs.</p></div></div>

    <h1>
        How we can stop discrimination against journalists and protect human rights defenders
    </h1>
    
    <p>
        The reason most journalists and human rights defenders are killed and discriminated is because their occupation comes with an inherent danger. This is because 
        journalists and human rights defenders speak up about crimes and distribute information that's classified and could harm the reputation of countries or people. 
    </p>
    
    <h1>Solutions we can take to stop discrimination</h1>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Breaking the cycle of Impunity</li>
        <li>Put a global focus on violence against journalists</li>
       
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Breaking the cycle of Impunity</h2>
    
    <p>For many cases regarding crimes and violence directed towards journalists, the people who cause these crimes aren't held responsible or accountable for them.
        We believe that the more these criminals aren't held accountable for these crimes the more they'll commit them because they'll believe that there are no consequences to
    their actions. Furthermore, this cycle of criminals affirming their actions because of the impunity of society will only continue working to normalize the discrimination of
    journalists. For example, 90% of of cases in which journalists are murdered, those responsible are not held to account. However, actions we could take to end impunity are 
    speaking up about crimes against journalists and advocating for their safety.</p>
    
    <h2>Putting a global focus on violence against journalists.</h2>
    
    <p>As conflict continues to grow nationally the death of journalists also continue to grow. This is because journalists are often targeted when reporting from 
        conflict zones. The situation needs to be addressed globally because these countries aren't held accountable for the deaths they cause and violence they commit during times of
        war. Furthermore, if the situation is not addressed it enables these countries to continue their violence against human rights defenders, and journalists. 
       
    </p>

    <img class="safe" src="safety.jpg">
    <p style="padding: 5px; list-style-position: inside; margin-bottom: 10px;">This image shows a journalist wearing protective gear in order to safely report what's occurring in conflict zones. In light of all the violence targeting journalists, media workers should be well-briefed and prepared, particularly in conflict areas, believe both Griffen and Ades-Mevel.

        Media organizations must be sure to adopt safety protocols, allocate enough resources to protect journalists, and ensure proper training of journalists, Griffen says.
        
        "In the case of Ukraine, for example, it is very important that journalists are equipped with helmets or jackets," Ades-Mevel points out, and adds that Reporters Without Borders has provided some such equipment there.</p>
