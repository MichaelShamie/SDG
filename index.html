    <h2>About SDG 16.10</h2>
    <p>SDG 16.10 aims to ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements.</p>
    <p>Every year, dozens of journalists and human rights defenders are killed or go missing while exposing corruption and injustice.</p>
    <p>Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16.10 is a key part of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda, focusing on ensuring public access to information and protecting fundamental freedoms like expression, the press, and assembly. These rights are essential for transparency, accountability, and inclusive societies, empowering individuals to participate in governance and hold leaders accountable.</p>
<p>However, achieving this goal faces significant challenges. Journalists, activists, and human rights defenders often risk their lives to expose corruption and injustice. Every year, dozens are killed, imprisoned, or go missing, with many cases unresolved due to impunity. This not only silences critical voices but also discourages others from speaking out.</p>
<p>Marginalized groups, such as women and minorities, face additional barriers, including gender-based violence and discrimination. Meanwhile, technology plays a dual role: while the internet and social media democratize access to information, they are also used to spread misinformation, surveil activists, and suppress dissent.</p>
<p>To advance SDG 16.10, governments, civil society, and the private sector must work together to strengthen legal frameworks, combat impunity, promote media literacy, and support independent media. By safeguarding these freedoms, we can build a more just, transparent, and equitable world.</p>

    <h1>
        How we can stop discrimination against journalists and protect human rights defenders
    </h1>

    <p>
        The reason most journalists and human rights defenders are killed and discriminated is because their occupation comes with an inherent danger. This is because 
        journalists and human rights defenders speak up about crimes and distribute information that's classified and could harm the reputation of countries or people. 
    </p>

    <h1>Solutions we can take to stop discrimination</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Breaking the cycle of Impunity</li>
        <li>Put a global focus on violence against journalists</li>
       
    </ul>

    <h2>Breaking the cycle of Impunity</h2>

    <p>For many cases regarding crimes and violence directed towards journalists, the people who cause these crimes aren't held responsible or accountable for them.
        We believe that the more these criminals aren't held accountable for these crimes the more they'll commit them because they'll believe that there are no consequences to
    their actions. Furthermore, this cycle of criminals affirming their actions because of the impunity of society will only continue working to normalize the discrimination of
    journalists. For example, 90% of of cases in which journalists are murdered, those responsible are not held to account. However, actions we could take to end impunity are 
    speaking up about crimes against journalists and advocating for their safety.</p>
